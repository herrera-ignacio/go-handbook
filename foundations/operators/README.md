# Operators

Go's binary operators for arithmetic, logic, and comparison are listed here in order of decreasing precedence:

* *Bitwise*: \* / % << >> & &^

* *Arithmetic*: \+ \- | ^

* *Comparison*: == != < <= > >=

* *Logic*: && (higher precedence), ||

So there are only **five levels of precedence for binary operators**. Operators at the same level associate to the left, so parentheses may be required for clarity.
