# Declarations

A *declaration* names a program entity and specifies some or all of its properties.

There are four major kinds of declarations: `var`, `const`, `type`, and `func`.

A function declaration has a name, a list of parameters, an optional list of results, and the function body. The result list is omitted if the function does not return anything.
