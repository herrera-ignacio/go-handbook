# Some History

Go was conceived in September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, all at Google, and was announced in November 2009. The goals of the language and its accompanying tools were to be expressive, efficient in both compilation and execution, and effective in writing reliable and robust programs.

## Go Fundamental Ideas

It borrows and adapts good ideas from many other languages, while avoiding features that have led to complexity and unreliable code. It facilities for concurrency are new and efficient, and its approach to data abstraction and object-oriented programming is unusually flexible. It has automatic memory management or *garbage collection*.

Go is especially well suited for building infrastructure like networked servers, and tools and systems for programmers, but it is truly a general-purpose languge and fins use in domains as diverse as graphics, mobile applications and machine learning. IT has beocme popular as a replacement for untyped scripting languages because it balances expressiveness with safety:

> Go programs typically run faster than programs written in dynamic languages and suffer far fewer crashes due to unexpected type errors.

Go is an open-source project, so source code for its compiler, libraries, and tools is freely available ot anyone.

## The Go Project

The Go Project was born of frustration with several software systems at Google that were suffering from an explosion of complexity.

As Rob Pike put it, "*complexity is multiplicative*": fixing a problem by making one part of the system more complex slowly but surely adds complexity to other parts. With constant pressure to add features and options and configurations, and to ship code quickly, it's easy to neglect simplicity, even though in the long run simplicity is the key to good software.

> Simplicity requires more work at the beginning of a project to reduce an idea to its essence and more discipline over the lifetime of a proejct to distingusih good changes from bad or pernicious ones. Only through simplicity of design can a system remain stable, secure, and coherent as it grows.

The Go project **includes the language itself, its tools and standard libraries, and last but not least, a cultural agenda of radical simplicity**.
